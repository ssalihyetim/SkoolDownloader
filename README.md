# Skool Video Downloader - Chrome Extension

Chrome extension to detect and download videos from Skool courses (Wistia and Loom).

## Features

- **Auto-detect videos** on Skool pages (Wistia, Loom, native Skool videos)
- **Intelligent file naming** - customizable patterns with course/title/platform variables
- **Settings page** - configure how videos are named
- **Video metadata extraction** - automatic title and course name detection
- **No login required** - uses your existing Skool session
- **Badge notification** showing number of videos found
- **Organized downloads** - create folder structures automatically

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension` folder from this repository
5. The extension is now installed!

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Navigate to Skool
Go to any Skool course page with videos

### 2. Scan for Videos
Click the extension icon - it will automatically scan for videos

### 3. Configure Settings (Optional)
- Click the **⚙️ Settings** button (appears after scan)
- Or right-click extension icon → "Options"
- Set your naming pattern (default: `{course}/{title}`)

**Naming Pattern Variables:**
- `{course}` - Course name from URL
- `{title}` - Video/lesson title
- `{platform}` - wistia, loom, or skool
- `{id}` - Video ID

**Example Patterns:**
```
{course}/{title}          → my-course/lesson-1-intro.mp4
{title}                   → lesson-1-intro.mp4
{platform}_{title}        → wistia_lesson-1-intro.mp4
downloads/{course}/{title} → downloads/my-course/lesson-1-intro.mp4
```

### 4. Enable "Ask Where to Save" in Chrome (Important!)
To choose where videos are saved:
- Go to `chrome://settings/downloads`
- Enable **"Ask where to save each file before downloading"**
- Or click the link in the extension's tip message

Without this setting, Chrome will download directly to your Downloads folder.

### 5. Download Videos
- Click **⬇️ Download** on any video
- Chrome will show a "Save As" dialog with the suggested filename
- Choose where to save it
- Done!

## Video Types

The extension handles different video types:

1. **Direct MP4** (Wistia, some Skool) - Downloads directly with Chrome
2. **M3U8/HLS Streams** (Most Skool native videos) - Requires ffmpeg command-line tool

For M3U8 streams:
- Extension provides ready-to-use ffmpeg command
- Includes proper filename from your naming pattern
- Just paste and run in Terminal
- See [M3U8_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md](M3U8_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md) for details

## How It Works

1. **Metadata Extraction:** Extension reads course name from URL and lesson title from the page
2. **Pattern Application:** Your naming pattern is applied with the extracted data
3. **Filename Generation:** A clean filename is created (invalid characters removed)
4. **Save Dialog:** Chrome shows the save dialog with suggested path/filename
5. **Your Choice:** You pick the final download location
