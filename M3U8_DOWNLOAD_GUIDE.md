# HLS/M3U8 Video Download Guide

## What are M3U8/HLS Streams?

Many Skool courses use **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)** for their native videos. These are `.m3u8` files that contain video segments, not a single video file. They cannot be downloaded directly through the browser.

## How to Download M3U8 Videos

### Step 1: Install ffmpeg

**ffmpeg** is a free tool that can download and convert M3U8 streams to MP4 files.

#### macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows:
1. Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Add ffmpeg to your PATH, or use the full path to ffmpeg.exe

### Step 2: Use the Extension

1. Navigate to a Skool course page with videos
2. Click the extension icon
3. Find the video you want to download
4. Look for videos marked as **"🎞️ HLS Stream - Requires ffmpeg"**
5. Click **"📋 Copy Command"**

### Step 3: Run the Command

1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to where you want to save the video:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
3. Paste the command (it's already in your clipboard!)
4. Press Enter
5. Wait for the download to complete

### Example

The extension will copy a command like this:
```bash
ffmpeg -headers "Referer: https://skool.com/" -i "https://stream.video.skool.com/...master.m3u8" -c copy "course-name/lesson-title.mp4"
```

This command will:
- Download the M3U8 stream
- Use the proper filename from your naming pattern
- Create folders if needed
- Save as MP4 format

## Understanding the Command

```bash
ffmpeg -headers "Referer: https://skool.com/" -i "VIDEO_URL" -c copy "OUTPUT.mp4"
```

- `ffmpeg` - The tool that does the downloading
- `-headers "Referer: https://skool.com/"` - Tells the server where the request is coming from (required for Skool videos)
- `-i "VIDEO_URL"` - The input M3U8 stream URL
- `-c copy` - Copy the stream without re-encoding (fast, no quality loss)
- `"OUTPUT.mp4"` - The output filename (automatically generated by the extension)

## Naming and Organization

The extension automatically generates the filename based on your naming pattern in Settings:

- Default pattern: `{course}/{title}`
- Result: `javascript-masterclass/lesson-1-intro.mp4`

The command will:
1. Create the `javascript-masterclass` folder if it doesn't exist
2. Save the video with the proper name
3. Use the course/lesson names from the page

## Troubleshooting

### "ffmpeg: command not found"
- ffmpeg is not installed or not in your PATH
- Install ffmpeg following the instructions above
- On Windows, use the full path: `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe ...`

### Download fails or gives errors
- Make sure you're logged into Skool in the same browser
- The video might be private or protected
- Try opening the video in browser first, then copy the command again

### No folder created / saved in wrong location
- The command runs from your **current directory** in Terminal
- Use `cd` to navigate to where you want to save:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Downloads
  ```
- Or use absolute paths in your naming pattern

### Want to choose quality?
By default, ffmpeg downloads the best quality. To choose a specific quality:

1. Open the M3U8 URL in a text editor or browser
2. You'll see multiple stream URLs (720p, 1080p, etc.)
3. Copy the specific stream URL you want
4. Replace the URL in the command

## Alternative: Manual Download

If you don't want to use ffmpeg:

1. Install a browser extension like "Video DownloadHelper"
2. Or use online services (not recommended for private content)
3. Or use Chrome DevTools to capture the stream

### Using Chrome DevTools:
1. Open video page
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Network tab
4. Filter by "m3u8"
5. Play the video
6. Right-click the m3u8 request → Copy URL
7. Use with ffmpeg or another tool

## Why Can't the Extension Download M3U8 Automatically?

Chrome extensions cannot:
- Run command-line tools like ffmpeg
- Download and reassemble video segments
- Save large files without user interaction

M3U8 streams are designed for streaming, not downloading. They consist of many small segments that need to be:
1. Downloaded individually
2. Combined in the correct order
3. Converted to a single video file

This is why ffmpeg (or similar tools) are required.

## Tips

1. **Use meaningful naming patterns** - The extension uses your pattern to name files
2. **Navigate to target folder first** - Use `cd` before running the command
3. **Check ffmpeg version** - Run `ffmpeg -version` to verify installation
4. **Batch downloads** - Copy multiple commands and run them sequentially
5. **Background downloads** - Use `&` at the end on Mac/Linux to run in background
